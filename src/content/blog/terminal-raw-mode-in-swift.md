description: When the standard library just doesn't quite cut it
---

The Swift standard library, while quite minimal on its own, typically does its job and does it very very well. But sometimes, there's just something you need to do that the standard library can't help you with. I ran into this situation some months ago while I was working on [BrainflipKit](https://github.com/kaascevich/BrainflipKit) -- I needed a way to switch the terminal to raw mode so that programs could recieve input without the terminal line-buffering it.

This sort of thing is why Swift has C interop built right in!

Granted, it's... not the most elegant thing out there, what with the bit manipulation and `withUnsafePointer(to:_:)` and C's incomprehensible identifiers. But I think that's kinda sorta the idea -- Swift makes _damn sure_ you don't shoot yourself in the foot with much of anything, but if dropping down to C was super easy, it wouldn't make much of a difference.

```swift
import Darwin.C // `Glibc` on Linux
import class Foundation.FileHandle

/// The standard input file descriptor.
private let standardInput = FileHandle.standardInput.fileDescriptor

/// Encapsulates the process of enabling and disabling raw mode
/// for a terminal.
@MainActor enum TerminalRawMode {
  /// Returns a `termios` struct representing the current
  /// state of the terminal.
  ///
  /// - Returns: A `termios` struct representing the current
  ///   state of the terminal.
  @MainActor private static func getTerminalState() -> termios {
    var currentTerminalState = termios()
    _ = tcgetattr(standardInput, &currentTerminalState)
    return currentTerminalState
  }

  /// Sets the terminal state to the given `termios` struct.
  /// 
  /// - Parameter state: A `termios` struct to set the terminal
  ///   state to.
  @MainActor private static func setTerminalState(_ state: termios) {
    withUnsafePointer(to: state) {
      _ = tcsetattr(standardInput, TCSAFLUSH, $0)
    }
  }

  /// The original state of the terminal.
  @MainActor private static let originalTerminalState = getTerminalState()
  
  /// Enables raw mode.
  ///
  /// - Parameter enableEcho: Whether to echo characters as they 
  ///   are typed.
  @MainActor static func enable(echoing enableEcho: Bool) {
    var rawTerminalState = self.originalTerminalState
    
    // enable raw mode by disabling line buffering
    rawTerminalState.c_lflag &= ~UInt(ICANON)
    
    if !enableEcho {
      // disable echoing
      rawTerminalState.c_lflag &= ~UInt(ECHO)
    }
    
    // apply the new settings
    setTerminalState(rawTerminalState)
  }
  
  /// Disables raw mode.
  @MainActor static func disable() {
    setTerminalState(self.originalTerminalState)
  }
}
```

And here's how you should use it:

```swift
@MainActor func rawInput() {
  TerminalRawMode.enable(echoing: true)
  defer { TerminalRawMode.disable() }

  // ...
}
```

> **Important:** Don't forget to run `TerminalRawMode.disable()` at some point before your app exits -- if you forget to do this, your user's terminal will be all kinds of messed up.

> **Note:** If you use this in code that isn't isolated to the main actor, you won't be able to run `disable()` in a `defer` block.
