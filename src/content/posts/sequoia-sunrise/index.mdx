This is one of a few new wallpapers added in macOS Sequoia, and it serves as a
semi-default of sorts. And let me tell ya, I flippin' _adore_ it. Like, Sequoia
Sunrise is to me what [Bliss] was to everyone who existed at the time -- it's
just _perfect_.

This says something, considering that usually I'm the kind of person who avoids
<nobr>(semi-)default</nobr> wallpapers like they're Google products. (...please
tell me that's not just me.)

If this wallpaper evokes that feeling in you, too, then you're in luck. Here's
how you can get the wallpaper on your device.

## Macs running macOS Sequoia

1. Open System Settings &rarr; Wallpaper.
2. The wallpaper should be right at the top of the Landscape section (alongside
   a bunch of other beauties). Click it to start downloading it -- it's a bit
   shy of 500 megs, so be patient. Leave System Settings open while it
   downloads.
3. Once it's downloaded, it should apply automatically.

<Callout type='tip'>
If you want, you can also set it as your screensaver so that you get to stare at
a beautiful forest for even longer. To do this, simply turn on "Show as screen
saver".

Once it's on your device, you can also find the raw `.mov` file at
`/Library/Application Support/com.apple.idleassetsd/Customer/4KSDR240FPS`.

## Other devices (PCs, older Macs, iPhones, etc.)

You can save the image above directly to your device -- it's in full 4K
resolution (albeit as a `webp`, which you may have to [convert] first). If you
want it as a video, [Mr. Macintosh] has it hosted on Google Drive
[here][wallpaper].
