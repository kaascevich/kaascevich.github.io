This is what my current desktop setup looks like:

![My current desktop setup, with two icons on the right and a few widgets on the left.][desktop]

Ignoring the dock and menu bar for now, you'll notice my desktop is very clean
compared to most other desktops you'll find out there ([r/unixporn] being a
notable exception). Aside from the widgets, the only two things on it are my
internal disk[^1] and a document for school that I'm working on.

No folders. No ~~shortcuts~~ aliases. Nothing other than those 2 icons.

I use my desktop for 2 purposes and 2 purposes only:
- As a user-controlled `tmp` folder. Whatever I put on it is stuff that I am
  actively working on, and as soon as I'm done with something, I either move it
  to a permanent home somewhere else (usually somewhere in another folder in my
  home directory), or throw it straight into the trash.
- As a place to keep mounted disks. This kinda falls under the above category,
  because all external disk icons are automatically removed by the Finder as
  soon as they're unmounted. The internal disk is mostly there to keep my
  desktop from feeling _too_ empty.

_"But how can you open ~~Chrome~~ Safari without a desktop icon?"_ I hear some
(hopefully none) of you asking. Simple: I use these crazy things called
_Launchpad_ and the _dock_.[^2] I pin apps that I use often to my dock, and keep
everything else hidden away in Launchpad. Y'know, using them both for their
_intended purposes_.

## Things that aren't shortcuts

Now, granted, desktop shortcuts aren't something you see very often on Macs.
Those are more of a Windows thing.[^3] But miscellaneous icons (folders named
`pics`, random PDFs, and the like) are pretty much universal in the computer
world. While I'm not _as_ perverse to storing actually meaningful stuff on the
desktop as I am towards putting shortcuts there, the fact that so many people
put _every single file they've ever used_ on the desktop has soured it a bit for
me.

Throwing all of your stuff on the desktop utterly defeats the original purpose
of the desktop -- a convenient place to store and quickly access things you use
**all the time**. Think of your computer's filesystem like a freshly-cleaned-up
home office; you keep the stuff you use most often on your desk where you can
reach them easily, while the stuff you use only occasionally is hidden away in
desk drawers and filing cabinets and whatnot.

Also, filling your desktop with icons obscures that super-nice wallpaper you
spent ages looking for. Which is just a shame more than anything.

[^1]: I should probably remove this icon at some point, because I keep obsessing
  over free disk space even though macOS generally knows what it's doing with
  it. But for now, it stays.
[^2]: In reality, I actually use Spotlight more often than not, simply because
  my hands are already on the keyboard and it's faster for me to type than to
  click. But my point still stands.
[^3]: And Windows makes desktop shortcuts _even more annoying_. Primarily
  because it's possible for apps to put shortcuts on what's called the "public
  desktop", which forces that shortcut onto all users of the device and makes it
  impossible to delete without admin rights.

  Which is why I tend to just turn off desktop icons entirely on Windows
  machines, 'cause that's a thing you can do (right-click the desktop &rarr;
  View &rarr; Show desktop icons).
