<Callout type='note' title='Update #2'>
**It appears Apple has fixed both of the below issues in macOS 15.2.** I'm
leaving the below workaround here in case anyone who hasn't yet updated comes
across this article.
</Callout>

<Callout type='note' title='Update #1'>
I've found a (temporary) solution to the first problem described in this
article:
1. Open Activity Monitor and choose View &rarr; All Processes.
2. Search for `coreaudiod`, and click the Stop icon in the toolbar.
3. An alert will appear asking if you really want to kill `coreaudiod`. Choose
   Quit, and authenticate if asked. `coreaudiod` will immediately restart after
   you kill it; this is expected.
4. AXVisualSupportAgent should immediately stop using the microphone, and won't
   use it again until your Mac restarts.

Alternatively, if you're of the do-it-quickly type, just run this in a terminal:

```console
$ sudo killall coreaudiod
```

You will need to perform these steps again every time you restart your Mac until
Apple provides an official fix.

## Issue #1

For several months now, "Accessibility Services" has been using my microphone
for _something_ non-stop:

![The mic indicator in my menu bar. "Accessibility Services" is using the mic.][mic]

Checking in Activity Monitor, this app is located at
`/System/Library/PrivateFrameworks/UniversalAccess.framework/Resources/AXVisualSupportAgent.app`.[^1]
It seems to be responsible for handling the screen zoom feature of macOS. As far
as I'm aware, this thing should have _no reason_ to be using the mic.

Yet, checking the `entitlements.plist` embedded within the executable shows that
AXVisualSupportAgent does indeed have permission to use the mic without user
authorization:

```plist
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
<plist version="1.0">
<dict>
  <!-- ... -->
  <key>com.apple.private.tcc.allow</key>
  <array>
    <string>kTCCServiceAccessibility</string>
    <string>kTCCServiceMicrophone</string>
  </array>
  <key>com.apple.security.device.audio-input</key>
  <true/>
  <!-- ... -->
  <key>com.apple.security.temporary-exception.audio-unit-host</key>
  <true/>
</dict>
</plist>
```

So this is, at some level, intentional. But I don't even have any mic-related
accessibility features _enabled_, let alone being used. _So why is this thing
constantly using my microphone?_

To this day, I still don't have a clue what's going on here. So please, if you
have _any_ idea as to what might be going on, [let me know][email] so I can get
this goddamn icon out of my menu bar.

## Issue #2

There's also another issue I'm having with AXVisualSupportAgent that doesn't
appear to be related to the one above -- it seems to be leaking memory at a rate
of about a megabyte every 20 seconds. I'm even more clueless as to what might be
causing this, so again, [please contact me][email] if you have any suggestions.

[^1]: The fact that this app is located in the System folder is enough to prove
  that it isn't malware, because the firmware refuses to boot macOS if the
  System volume has been modified in _any_ way. It's really neat, you can read
  more about it [here][ssv].
