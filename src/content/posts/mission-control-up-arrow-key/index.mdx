Fun fact: if you have "Group windows by application" turned on in Mission
Control settings, you can press the up arrow key while hovering over a window to
focus on all the windows from that app:

![The Mission Control interface, focusing on all VSCodium windows.][mission-control]

This doesn't seem _particularly_ useful to me, since I personally keep the
number of open windows to a minimum, but it's something new to me nonetheless.
