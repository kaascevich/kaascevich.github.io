Hurricane Milton was a tropical storm yesterday morning. 24 hours later, it
ballooned into a Category 3 hurricane. Now, [it's a Cat 5][news]. All the models
roughly agree on its path -- straight up the I-4 corridor.

We live on the east coast of Florida, so when Helene wandered along the west
coast a week and a half ago, we were rather lucky -- we got away with a day of
heavy rain and a single tornado warning that didn't end up amounting to
anything. But it seems these hurricanes are remarkably determined to cause as
much chaos in this godforsaken state as possible, because not only are we about
to get hit by another hurricane, it'll be _a direct hit_.[^1]

Stay safe, fellow peoples. This state is an absolute disaster right now.

[^1]: Or at least as direct a hit as you can get when hitting it from the wrong
direction, but it's still pretty direct.
