Y'know, it's been a while since I've done any real Swift programming. I think I
should try something marginally new for once.

```console
$ cd developer/other/swift
```

But what to call it?

Well, there's one name I've had on my mind before when considering starting
something like this. Let's roll with that one.

```console
$ mkdir Aurora
$ cd aurora # case-insensitive file systems FTW
$ swift package init
Creating library package: Aurora
Creating Package.swift
Creating .gitignore
Creating Sources/
Creating Sources/Aurora/Aurora.swift
Creating Tests/
Creating Tests/AuroraTests/
Creating Tests/AuroraTests/AuroraTests.swift
$ git init
Initialized empty Git repository in /Users/kaleb/Developer/Other/Swift/Aurora/.git/
$ code .
```

Opening up the autogenerated `Package.swift`, we are greeted with this
formatting horror:

```swift
// swift-tools-version: 6.0
// The swift-tools-version declares the minimum version of Swift required to build this package.

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
    name: "Aurora",
    products: [
        // Products define the executables and libraries a package produces, making them visible to other packages.
        .library(
            name: "Aurora",
            targets: ["Aurora"]),
    ],
    targets: [
        // Targets are the basic building blocks of a package, defining a module or a test suite.
        // Targets can depend on other targets in this package and products from dependencies.
        .target(
            name: "Aurora"),
        .testTarget(
            name: "AuroraTests",
            dependencies: ["Aurora"]
        ),
    ]
)
```

Let's fix this up, and add a dependency on `swift-parsing` while we're at it:

<GitHub client:visible repo="pointfreeco/swift-parsing"/>

```swift
// swift-tools-version: 6.0

import PackageDescription

let package = Package(
  name: "Aurora",
  platforms: [.macOS(.v15)],
  products: [
    .library(name: "Aurora", targets: ["Aurora"]),
  ],
  dependencies: [
    .package(
      url: "https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-parsing",
      from: .init(0, 14, 1)
    ),
  ],
  targets: [
    .target(
      name: "Aurora",
      dependencies: [
        .product(name: "Parsing", package: "swift-parsing"),
      ]
    ),
    .testTarget(
      name: "AuroraTests",
      dependencies: ["Aurora"]
    ),
  ]
)
```

Much better.

Anyway, throughout this little hopefully-not-woefully-short-lived series, I'm
gonna try to follow the basic principles of test-driven development, now that
[Swift Testing] is here to make that a bearable prospect. tl;dr: I'll write the
tests first, then write some code until the compiler stops screaming at me, then
write even more code until I get that glorious green checkmark on the last line
of the output of `swift test`. Rinse and repeat.

In the first part,[^1] I'll actually start doing that.

[^1]: This is the _zeroth_ part, remember?
