I'm putting the NixOS project on hold. I don't know for how long. Possibly
indefinitely. We'll see.

If you live in the US (like me), you probably know that the federal government
is in... a bit of a messy state right now. With tensions all over this
godforsaken planet that I won't delve into because I'm not even remotely
qualified for it, [r/prepping] is seeming like a place more and more people will
discover in the coming years/months/weeks/days/attoseconds.

Now, what the hell do American political tensions and a random subreddit have to
do with a 10-year-old MacBook Air?

Well, under the assumption that I can find a decently cheap 512+ GB SSD and
stuff it in the laptop (and probably get the battery replaced if at all
possible, because it's also 10 years old and only holds, like, 2 hours of charge
on idle), my [Early 2014 1.4GHz 4GB RAM Core i5 11" MacBook Air][MacBook Air]
would actually serve as a solid offline digital library, so that if shenanigans
do end up hitting the fan and the internet evaporates, melts, or otherwise
becomes inaccessible, I'll still have _some_ way to avoid dying in this horror
story[^1] of a world.

That was a long run-on sentence, so let's make it actually meaningful, shall we?

## Step 1: choosing an OS

Of course, I _could_ just (re)install macOS onto the Mac like God intended and
call it a day. But there are a couple issues with this:
- The last version of macOS that will run on this thing without
  [OpenCore patching] is 11.7.10 Big Sur. For context, macOS 15 Sequoia launched
  less than a month ago.
- In the apocalypse, no major corporation can be trusted -- that's just common
  sense. Unfortunately, even Apple counts as a major corporation.
- I just wanna have fun with Linux, okay?

After a quick [Ecosia][Ecosia][^2] search, Debian seems like a
pretty solid choice to tick all these boxes:
- Debian supports most of the hardware in the laptop out-of-the-box.
  (Unfortunately, the Wi-Fi module is not in that list. But I have a solution
  for that.)
- It's more like a federation than a corporation.
- It's Linux.

It's also exceedingly stable, which is probably the #1 reason I chose it.

## Step 2: doing the instally thing

The [live GNOME ISO] was easy enough to flash to an SD card. I stuck it in an
adapter, stuck that into the MacBook, and stuck my finger onto the option key to
load the boot picker.

<Callout type="note">
For some odd reason, the boot picker shows _two_ bootable external disks instead
of just the one. I don't think it matters in the end what you pick, because they
both seem to boot fine.
</Callout>

When booting the card, I chose "Start installer" instead of "Live system",
because the latter left me with a broken install for some reason. I went through
the installer like normal, making sure to skip networking setup since there's no
Wi-Fi drivers in the installer.[^3] Since it was a GNOME live image, the
installer automatically installed GNOME without needing a network connection,
which was rather convenient.

Once installed, it boots on the MacBook without any trouble. But there's still
no Wi-Fi -- let's fix that.

### We need the internet to download the internet

I don't remember where I got it from, but I found a copy of the needed Wi-Fi
driver somewhere on the internet, which you can download
<a download href="$/assets/other/broadcom-sta-dkms_6.30.223.271-23_all.deb">here</a>.
I copied it to another spare SD card and mounted it on the newly-Debianized
MacBook, opened a terminal and ran this:

```console
$ cd /media/username/diskname # replace username and diskname as needed
$ sudo dpkg -i broadcom-sta-dkms_6.30.223.271-23_all.deb
sudo: password for username:
Unpacking broadcom-sta-dkms (6.30.223.271-23) over (6.30.223.271-23) ...
Setting up broadcom-sta-dkms (6.30.223.271-23) ...
Loading new broadcom-sta-dkms-6.30.223.271 DKMS files...
Building for 6.1.0-25-amd64
Building initial module for 6.1.0-25-amd64
Done.

wl.ko:
Running module version sanity check.
 - Original module
   - No original module exists within this kernel
 - Installation
   - Installing to /lib/modules/6.1.0-25-amd64/updates/dkms/
depmod...
```

One reboot later (why `reboot` or `shutdown` don't exist, I don't know):

```console
$ systemctl reboot
```

And just like that, Wi-Fi is up and running!

The only piece of hardware that doesn't work at all on Linux is the FaceTime
camera, but since this is a laptop for the apocalypse, that's probably a good
thing.

In the next part, I'll work on actually turning this thing into an excellent
offline library (to the furthest extent I can with only ~115GB to work with).

[^1]: I don't _like_ horror stories.
[^2]: I'd rather use [Startpage](https://startpage.com), but Ecosia is what
  Safari's search engine picker gives me, so Ecosia it is.
[^3]: Or trackpad drivers. The trackpad worked fine after installing, so I
  don't know what's up with that.
