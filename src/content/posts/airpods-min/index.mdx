Here's what the Apple event earlier this month brought to the $549 AirPods Max:
- New colors
- USB-C
- Personalized Spatial Audio

Here's what that very same event brought to the $179 AirPods 4 with ANC:
- H2 chip
- Voice Isolation
- Active Noise Cancellation
- Transparency
- Adaptive Audio
- Conversation Awareness
- Personalized Volume
- IP54 dust and water resistance
- Just say "Siri"
- Head shaking for Siri responses
- Bluetooth 5.3

Do you see a discrepancy here?

The AirPods Max had been around for 4 years without a single update. Meanwhile,
the Pros kept getting more and more and more new stuff, and now the base AirPods
have a bunch of it too. And Apple thinks they can get away with nothing but new
colors and a new charging port?

Don't get me wrong, the updates we _did_ get to the AirPods Max are nice to
have. And the Maxes are still quite good headphones (if a _little_ overpriced).
The problem is that there are _much better_ headphones on the market now, and
Apple doesn't seem to care.

I was _so excited_ for Apple to announce a new version of the AirPods Max at the
September event. But we got a disgrace instead.
