The Swift standard library, while relatively minimal on its own, typically does
its job and does it very very well. But sometimes, there's just something you
need to do that the standard library can't help you with. I ran into this
situation some months ago while I was working on [BrainflipKit] -- I needed a
way to switch the terminal to raw mode so that programs could recieve input
without the terminal line-buffering it.

This sort of thing is why Swift has C interop built right in!

Granted, it's... not the most elegant thing out there, what with the bit
manipulation and `withUnsafePointer(to:_:)` and C's incomprehensible
identifiers. But I think that's kinda sorta the idea -- Swift makes _damn sure_
you don't shoot yourself in the foot with much of anything, but if dropping
down to C was super easy, it wouldn't make much of a difference.

```swift
import Darwin.C // `Glibc` on Linux
import class Foundation.FileHandle

/// The standard input file descriptor.
private let standardInput = FileHandle.standardInput.fileDescriptor

/// Encapsulates the process of enabling and disabling raw mode
/// for a terminal.
@MainActor enum TerminalRawMode {
  /// Returns a `termios` struct representing the current
  /// state of the terminal.
  ///
  /// - Returns: A `termios` struct representing the current
  ///   state of the terminal.
  @MainActor private static func getTerminalState() -> termios {
    var currentTerminalState = termios()
    _ = tcgetattr(standardInput, &currentTerminalState)
    return currentTerminalState
  }

  /// Sets the terminal state to the given `termios` struct.
  /// 
  /// - Parameter state: A `termios` struct to set the terminal
  ///   state to.
  @MainActor private static func setTerminalState(_ state: termios) {
    withUnsafePointer(to: state) {
      _ = tcsetattr(standardInput, TCSAFLUSH, $0)
    }
  }

  /// The original state of the terminal.
  @MainActor private static let originalTerminalState = getTerminalState()
  
  /// Enables raw mode.
  ///
  /// - Parameter enableEcho: Whether to echo characters as they 
  ///   are typed.
  @MainActor static func enable(echoing enableEcho: Bool) {
    var rawTerminalState = self.originalTerminalState
    
    // enable raw mode by disabling line buffering
    rawTerminalState.c_lflag &= ~UInt(ICANON)
    
    if !enableEcho {
      // disable echoing
      rawTerminalState.c_lflag &= ~UInt(ECHO)
    }
    
    // apply the new settings
    setTerminalState(rawTerminalState)
  }
  
  /// Disables raw mode.
  @MainActor static func disable() {
    setTerminalState(self.originalTerminalState)
  }
}
```

And here's how you should use it:

```swift
@MainActor func rawInput() {
  TerminalRawMode.enable(echoing: true)
  defer { TerminalRawMode.disable() }

  // ...
}
```

<Callout type="important">
Don't forget to run `TerminalRawMode.disable()` at some point before your app
exits -- if you forget to do this, your user's terminal will be all kinds of
messed up.
</Callout>

<Callout type="note">
If you use this in code that isn't isolated to the main thread with
`@MainActor`, you won't be able to run `disable()` in a `defer` block. This is
because you need to use `await` to call these functions from another thread, and
at the time of writing Swift doesn't support `await` in `defer` blocks (even if
the containing function is `async`).
